We have the following output:
Sure, based on the information you provided, I would like the software consulting firm to build a landing page for a global pharmaceutical company that is research and development-driven and committed to improving the health of patients. The landing page should have an image of "HOME" in the top left corner, an input field for search in the right edge and above center, and an input field for entering email address in the bottom right corner. The landing page should also have four buttons: a white "SUBSCRIBE" button in the bottom and right center, a black "Cookies Settings" button below and to the right of center, a red "Reject All" button in the bottom and right center, and a red "Accept All Cookies" button in the bottom and right center. The landing page should not have any iframes.
